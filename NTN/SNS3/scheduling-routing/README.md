# SNS3 Routing & Scheduling Notes

## Purpose
This folder organizes study notes for sns-3 focusing on routing and scheduling.

## Structure
- 00_overview → high-level picture
- 01_mac_layer → MAC logic + scheduling hooks
- 02_routing_layer → routing logic + classes
- 03_scheduling_algorithms → schedulers
- 04_packet_flow_trace → TX and RX flow
- 05_class_relationships → diagrams
- 06_key_source_files → annotated code
- 07 Experiments → tests

## Study Workflow
1. Pick a source file.
2. Annotate lines into the corresponding file in `06_key_source_files/annotations/`.
3. Update diagrams under `05_class_relationships/`.
4. Update corresponding flow traces under `04_packet_flow_trace/`.
5. Summarize in each module directory.

## Notes
This directory is meant to evolve as you study sns-3 deeper.
