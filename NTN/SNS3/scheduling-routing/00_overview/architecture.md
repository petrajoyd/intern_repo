# Architecture Overview (SNS3 — Routing & Scheduling)

## Purpose
Explain the overall relationship between PHY, MAC, routing, queues, and scheduler.

## 1. High-Level Diagram
<!-- TODO: Draw block diagram: Application → Transport → L3 → Routing → L2/MAC → Scheduler → PHY → Channel -->

## 2. Key Concepts
- Packets
- Frames
- Scheduling opportunities
- Routing decisions

## 3. Where decisions occur
- Routing decision (L3)
- Scheduling decision (MAC)
- Queue management (QueueDisc)

## 4. Notes
<!-- TODO: Insert your insights here -->
