**Example:**

This document presents an O-RAN-based energy saving system for 5G Radio Access Networks (RAN), implementing intelligent multi-cell sleep mechanisms through open interfaces [6] and RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) [7].

1. **Background**: 
   - Mobile operators face high energy costs from continuously active base stations during low-traffic periods
   - Traditional RAN architectures lack standardized interfaces [2] for coordinated multi-cell energy optimization

2. **Importance**: 
   - Reduces operational costs by 30-40% through dynamic multi-cell energy management
   - Provides vendor-neutral solutions via O-RAN open interfaces while maintaining QoS

3. **Contribution**: 
   - O-RAN-compliant system leveraging ML-based traffic prediction (Non-RT RIC rApp) and real-time control (Near-RT RIC xApp) for dynamic multi-cell activation/deactivation
   - Novel O1/A1 [5]/E2 [6] interface coordination with intelligent handover algorithms [2] minimizing service disruption

4. **Challenges**: 
   - **UE Handover & QoS**: Zero dropped calls during cell transitions [3] while preventing congestion in remaining active cells
   - **Multi-Cell Coordination**: Accurate traffic prediction and reliable O1/A1/E2 communication for synchronized shutdown/activation decisions

### Components Explanation

#### [SMO Layer - O-RAN SC [L Release]](installation-guide-link)

- **[SMO Platform](smo-installation-link) (10.10.5.10)**: The Service Management and Orchestration platform [7] serves as the top-level management entity in the O-RAN architecture, providing centralized network management, service orchestration, and policy control. Implemented using O-RAN SC L Release, it communicates with lower layers through O1 [4] and A1 [5] interfaces to configure network functions, collect performance metrics, and enforce high-level policies. The SMO enables network slicing, resource allocation optimization, and lifecycle management of RAN components while maintaining a unified view of the entire network topology.

- **[VES Collector](ves-installation-link) (Port 8080)**: The VES (Virtual Event Streaming) Collector receives fault, performance, and event notifications from RAN components through the O1 interface [4]. It normalizes event data from different vendors into a common format, enabling standardized monitoring and analytics across heterogeneous network elements. VES Collector forwards processed events to Kafka message bus for distribution to rApps and external management systems.

- **[NETCONF Server](netconf-installation-link) (Port 830)**: The NETCONF server provides standards-based configuration management for O-RAN network elements through YANG data models. It handles configuration requests from SMO applications, validates changes against YANG schemas, and applies configurations to RAN nodes via O1 interface [4]. The server maintains configuration versioning, supports transaction rollback, and ensures consistent state management across distributed network components.

- **[TEIV](teiv-installation-link) (Port 8081)**: Topology and Inventory (TEIV) service maintains a real-time graph database of network topology, including physical and logical relationships between RAN components. It tracks cell configurations, neighbor relations, hardware inventory, and network connectivity. TEIV provides APIs for rApps to query topology information, enabling intelligent decision-making for optimization algorithms based on current network structure.

- **[Energy Optimization rApp](rapp-installation-link) (Port 9090)**: The Energy Optimization rApp executes on the SMO platform to provide intelligent energy-saving policies based on long-term network analytics and machine learning models. It analyzes historical traffic patterns, cell utilization, and energy consumption data [1] collected over hours or days to generate optimization policies. The rApp trains ML models to predict traffic demand, determines optimal cell sleep schedules, and deploys these policies to the Near-RT RIC through the A1 interface [5] for real-time execution by xApps.

- **[Performance Monitoring rApp](pm-rapp-installation-link) (Port 9091)**: The Performance Monitoring rApp collects and analyzes long-term KPIs [1] from RAN components, detecting performance degradation trends and network anomalies. It aggregates metrics from multiple sources, generates performance reports, triggers alarms for SLA violations, and provides insights for capacity planning. The rApp supports custom analytics workflows and integrates with visualization tools to present network performance trends to operators.

- **[Grafana Dashboard](grafana-installation-link) (Port 3000)**: Grafana provides the web-based visualization and monitoring interface for network operators. It displays real-time and historical metrics including cell throughput, UE connections, resource utilization, and energy consumption across all network layers. Operators can create custom dashboards, configure alert thresholds, analyze performance trends, and correlate events across different network domains through interactive visualizations.

## Message Sequence Chart (MSC)

> [!NOTE]
> **Guideline:** Illustrate component interactions for each use case using sequence diagrams. Focus on message flow across system interfaces (O1, A1, E2, F1 for O-RAN). MSC shows **component communication**, while flowcharts show **algorithm logic**.
>
> **Required Content:**
>
> 1. **Sequence Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams showing message exchanges between components
> 2. **Interface Labels**: Include interface names (O1, A1, E2, F1, eCPRI, Uu)
> 3. **Message Content**: Document message parameters and data structures
> 4. **Timing**: Show order of operations and dependencies
> 5. **Error Scenarios**: Include alternative flows and error handling where relevant

### UC2: Handover UEs to Neighbor Cell

This MSC shows the handover procedure when the Energy Saving xApp decides to move UEs from a low-traffic cell to a neighbor cell before shutdown.

>
> 1. **Decision Points**: Show conditional branches using diamond shapes
> 2. **Logic Flow**: Include if/else logic and loops with clear conditions
> 3. **Threshold Values**: Document criteria and parameters for decisions
> 4. **Error Handling**: Show alternative paths for failure scenarios
> 5. **Clear Styling**: Use consistent colors and ensure text readability

## Class Diagram

> [!NOTE]
> **Guideline:** Define the software architecture using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Include classes, attributes (following 3GPP standards), methods, and relationships (inheritance, composition, aggregation).
> Include the parameters defined on the [System Parameters](#system-parameters) table.
>
> **Required Content:**
>
> 1. **Classes**: Define main classes following OOP design patterns
> 2. **Attributes**: Use 3GPP parameter names (e.g., `DRB.PrbUtilDL`, `RRC.ConnectedUE`)
> 3. **Methods**: Define functions that execute MSC call-flows
> 4. **Relationships**: Show inheritance (is-a), composition (has-a), aggregation, dependencies
> 5. **Access Modifiers**: Use `-` for private, `+` for public, `#` for protected
> 6. **Data Types**: Specify types (String, Integer, Float, List, etc.)
>
> **OOP Principles:**
>
> - **Encapsulation**: Group related data and methods in classes
> - **Abstraction**: Use interfaces or abstract classes where applicable
> - **Inheritance**: Show class hierarchies (e.g., `BaseXApp` → `EnergySavingXApp`)
> - **Polymorphism**: Define overridable methods

## System Parameters

> [!NOTE]
> **Guideline:** Define the input and output parameters used in the system, following 3GPP specifications. These parameters should be reflected in the class diagram attributes.
>
> **Required Content:**
>
> 1. **Input Parameters**: System inputs (e.g., KPIs from E2 interface, A1 policies)
> 2. **Output Parameters**: System outputs (e.g., control decisions, cell status)
> 3. **3GPP Standards**: Reference TS specifications for each parameter with hyperlinks
> 4. **Parameter Table**: Include columns for Category, Parameter, Type, 3GPP Spec, Unit, Description, Range, Source/Destination

**Example:**
